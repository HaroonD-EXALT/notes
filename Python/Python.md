# Python Basics:

Python is an interpreted language, user never invoke a compiler, he just run .py file and The Python implementation compiles the files as nedded. 
This is different than Java, for example, where you have to run the Java compiler to turn Java source code into compiled class files. For this reason, Java is often called a compiled language, while Python is called an interpreted language. But both compile to bytecode, and then both execute the bytecode with a software implementation of a virtual machine.

[Is Python interpreted or compiled ](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201803/is_python_interpreted_or_compiled_yes.html)

Another important Python feature is its interactive prompt. You can type Python statements and have them immediately executed. This interactivity is usually missing in “compiled” languages, but even at the Python interactive prompt, your Python is compiled to bytecode, and then the bytecode is executed. This immediate execution, and Python’s lack of an explicit compile step, are why people call the Python executable “the Python interpreter.”
