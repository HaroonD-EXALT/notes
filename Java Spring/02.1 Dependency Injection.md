# Dependency Injection

DI is a design pattern that removes the dependancy from code so that it can be easy to manage the application. 

## Dependency Lookup
The Dependency Lookup is an approach where we get the resource after demand. There can be various ways to get the resource for example:

```java 

A obj = new AImpl();
//In such way, we get the resource(instance of A class) directly by new keyword. Another way is factory method:

//This way, we get the resource (instance of A class) by calling the static factory method getA().
A obj = A.getA();

```


There are mainly two problems of dependency llokup:
* tight coupling 
* not easy for testing

## Dependency Injection 
is a design pattern that remoes the dependency of the programs. Provide the information from the external source such XML file.
```java 
class Employee{  
	Address address;  
	
	Employee(Address address){  
		this.address=address;  
	}  
	public void setAddress(Address address){  
		this.address=address;  
	} 
}
```

## Two ways to perform Dependancy Injection In Spring Framework

Spring framework provides two ways to inject dependency
